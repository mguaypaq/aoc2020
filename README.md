# Advent of Code 2020

Here are my solutions to the puzzles at [Advent of Code 2020]. This
year, my intentions are to:

* learn just enough [Zig] to write my solutions (using version 0.7.0,
  released 2020-11-08); and

* use git weirdly, as a narrative tool, by:
  * having a single branch,
  * describing my progress in commit messages,
  * tagging the final commit for each puzzle in the format `day1a`,
    `day1b`, `day2a`, etc., and
  * starting each day fresh, by removing the previous day's code :)
